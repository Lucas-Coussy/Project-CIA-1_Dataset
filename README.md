# Project: CIA-1 Dataset Analysis

This project presents a focused analysis of the **CIA-1 Dataset**, following a structured and reproducible data science workflow.

## Overview

The notebook walks through each critical stage of a typical machine learning pipeline:

### 1. **Data Exploration**
- Examines the dataset's structure, feature types, and missing values.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handles missing data, removes duplicates, and resolves inconsistencies.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Uses various plots to explore feature distributions and uncover relationships.

### 4. **Preprocessing Pipeline**
- Implements `make_pipeline` to standardize transformations and ensure consistency across training and testing phases.

### 5. **Model Building & Evaluation**
- Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) and evaluates performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Objective

To extract reliable insights and build an effective predictive model using data analysis and machine learning.

# Project: CIA-1 Dataset Analysis

This project presents a targeted analysis of the **CIA-1 Dataset**, applying a structured and reproducible data science process.

### 1. **Preprocessing**
- Analyzes the dataset structure and converts categorical variables into numerical form to prepare for modeling.

### 2. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Computes key summary statistics and examines the distribution of categorical features.

### 3. **Logistic Regression**
- Trains a logistic regression model and evaluates its performance on the dataset.

### 4. **Neural Network**
- Builds a basic neural network to compare performance with the logistic model and visualize outcomes.

## Objective

To derive meaningful insights and develop accurate predictive models using foundational machine learning techniques.
